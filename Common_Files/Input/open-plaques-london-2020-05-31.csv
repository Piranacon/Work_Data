He was later transferred  to the sloop, HMS Tisphone, and followed the Captain, Anthony Hunt, when he   was transferred to HMS Amphitrite in 1793.  In November of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and appointed to HMS  Meleager. This ship was part of a squadron off the coast of Genoa under the   command of Captain Horatio Nelson. In August 1796, Hardy transferred to HMS  Minerve with Captain Cockburn. At the end of the year, Nelson transferred to  the Sabina, Hardy, along with Lieutenant Culverhouse, was in charge of a boarding  party sent to claim her as a prize after her capture. They managed to draw off  the rest of the Spanish squadron, but the ship was later re-captured after  one of her masts was destroyed and Hardy was taken prisoner along with the rest  of the boarding party.    He was later repatriated with the Minerve at Gibraltar after an exchange of   prisoners, which included the Captain of the Sabina. Captain Nelson was warm  in praise of the actions of his lieutenants in this action.  Shortly after rejoining his ship, Hardy was nearly captured again by the   Spanish when he jumped overboard to save a seaman who was drowning after   falling out of one of the boats. The current had carried them towards the lead  ship of the Spanish squadron in the Gibraltar Straits. Nelson took instant action  by ordering shorten their sail and stand off. Hardy and the seaman were  rescued. A few days later, the ship had joined the British fleet and took part  in the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.  In the following Maym HMSs Minerve and Lively were patrolling around the bay of  Santa Cruz and found a French brig, the Mutine. On the 29th, longboats  from the two ships were sent to capture it under Hardy's command. It  was successful and Hardy was appointed to command of the prize by Admiral  Jervis. He also was promoted to Commander.    Hardy went to the Mediterranean with Nelson, who had been appointed Commander  in Chief. In July 1803, Nelson transferred to HMS Victory and Hardy joined him to   resume his position as Flag Captain.During the following months and years, the  ship was kept busy with the blockade of Toulon and continuing pursuit of the   Franco-Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. Hardy, along with Captain Blackwood,  witnessed Nelson's last will and during the battle of Trafalgar on   October 21st 1805, was walking along side his Commander in chief when a   French spiner fatally shot Nelson. As Nelson's Chief of Staff, he remained  on duty during the remainder of the battle while keeping his dying friend  and Commabder informed of the proceedings. In recognition for these  services, he was created a baronet. He played a major part in the state  funeral of Nelson on 9 January 1806 at St Paul's Cathedral.    Hardy was decorated as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath in  January 1815 and returned to Britain in June of that year. On his return,  he was appointed to command the Royal Yacht Princess Augusta. He served  on her for three years. In August 1819, he was promoted to Commodore and  appointed as Commander in Chief for the South American station. He  transferred his flag to HMS Superb and his services during the war of  independence that was being fought in the former Spanish colonies won  him praise from the Admiralty. He eventually returned to Britain in 1824.    In 1830, he was appointed as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He  retained this post until 1834. During this period, he was appointed  as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath. At the end of his period  as First Sea Lord, he was appointed as Governor of Greenwich Hospital.  During his time as Governor, he introduced many changes to improve the lives  of the pensioners. He was promoted as Vice Admiral in January 1837.  Hardy died on 20th September 1839 and was buried in the mausoleum in the   grounds of Greenwich Hospital.

The canons established the famous hospital of St. Thomas that was moved to Lambeth in the 19th century. After the dissolution of the monastery in 1539 the Priory Church became the Parish Church of St. Saviour, in the Diocese of Winchester. In 1905 it was made a Cathedral with its own diocese, to serve the spiritual and material needs of south London's growing population.     In monastic times the parish church was in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene formerly on the south side of the chancel (to your left) but demolished in 1822 during restoration work on the choir. You are looking down at the East Churchyard which contains the foundations of the 14th-century Lady Chapel and Bishop Andrewes' burial chapel. There also used to be houses built right up to the church. All these were demolished in the 1830s to make way for the approach road to John Rennie's new London Bridge.

In this way she was able to record her address, on the night of that census, as being ""The House of Commons"", thus making her claim to the same political rights as men.

The first official dispatches with the momentous news of the victory,and the death in action of Vice Admiral Lord Nelson,were carried on board H.M. Schooner PICKLE by her captain Lieutenant John Richards Lapenotiere. Lapenotiere landed at Falmouth on Monday 4th November 1805 and set out ""express by post-chaise"" for London, following what is now known as The Trafalgar Way. He took some 37 hours to cover the 271 mile journey, changing horses 21 times. The last of these was at Hounslow late at night on Tuesday 5th. His orders were to lose no time in reaching the Admiralty so, as the horses were still fresh, he pressed on through fog in Brentford and Chiswick towards Whitehall.  Over the following four weeks other important messages arrived from the fleet with further details of the victory and anxiously awaited information on casualties. All the dispatches were landed at Falmouth and their couriers took the same route through Brentford and Chiswick where horses and hospitality were available from the inns to all travellers on what is now The Trafalgar Way.

The station was to be a focal point for a new suburb and although some development took place, areas to the north and east of the station became part of the protected London Green Belt.  The station building is a low European style brick structure flanked by two small towers each with a pole mounted roundel.  The alignment of road and rail approaches was developed to produce a ticket hall concourse of pentagonal plan.  Reinforced concrete was used for the entire concourse and train shed.  At the time, the use of such materials, unadorned, was viewed as a modernistic approach to buildings in this country.  The station is located in a 'cutting' and required natural light to enter from above, so the roof was built in two levels with inclined celestory (sic) windows run-in the full length terminating in an apex above the concourse.  Other noteworthy elements of the station include the predominant use of bronze framed signs and windows, the original passimeter, rectangular train describer box with integral clock and the timber seats.  This station, along with adjoining stations on the Piccadilly line, are now internationally recognised as being some of the finest examples of 1930's architecture designed by Holden and Partners.

40694,openplaques:id=40694,Charles Holden brown plaque,"Chiswick Park station  Listed as a building of National Significance  Architect: Charles Holden, 1933  The station first opened on 1 July 1879 by the Metroploitan District Railway when the railway was extended from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway.  The station was originally named 'Acton Green' and was renamed to 'Chiswick Park' on 1 March 1910.  The original station was demolished in 1931 to accommodate the new Piccadilly line tracks, although the Piccadilly line has never served this station, and the new building opened in 1933.  The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.  Similar to the station at Arnos Grove that Holden designed for the eastern Piccadilly line extension, the station's predominant feature is the tall semi-circular ticket hall.  Externally the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.  To make the station's location visible from Chiswick High Road the station was also provided with a square brick tower surmounted by the roundel and the stations name.  The ticket hall once housed a central passimeter, whcih has now been replaced with the brick built ticket office accommodation which has altered the appearance of the grandiose hall.  The station was Grade II listed on 18 February 1987.",51.4943,-0.26761,POINT(-0.26761 51.4943),United Kingdom,London,Acton Lane,"",https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1709/23952806731_8c9424b3d4_z.jpg,brown,"[""London Underground""]",English,"",,true,true,1,1,0,0,16315,openplaques:subject:id=16315,Charles Holden,Holden,male,1875,1960,man,"[""Royal Designer for Industry"", ""Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects"", ""Doctor of Letters"", ""Member of the Royal Town Planning Institute""]","",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holden,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Holden,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Charles_Holden_by_Benjamin_Nelson.jpg?width=640,"[""Charles Holden|(1875-1960)|man|Royal Designer for Industry, Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Doctor of Letters, and Member of the Royal Town Planning Institute""]"

This new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first experimental section of the Underground’s surface lines to be electrified and operated electric instead of steam trains.  Sudbury Hill was to see the full development of the format and style Charles Holden had designed as Sudbury Town station in 1931, which he was to use for the majority of Underground stations during the 1930s.

The high ticket hall is illuminated by a large vertical window within each facade and an Underground roundel, with original graphics, is inset into the glazing above the entrance.  The design of the rest of the building deliberately integrates the overbridge, staircases to platforms and the waiting room accommodation into the overall architectural idiom.

Sudbury Town seen as one of the seminal works of the architect Charles Holden and as such it set many of the elements for the other Underground stations he was to design in the 1930s.  It saw the move away from the use of Portland stone, as had been seen on his previous designs for stations such as Ealing Common, towards a more European idiom based on unadorned concrete and brick that was a real change in British architecture of the day.  It is viewed by many many as being one of Britain’s best buildings of the time.  The main structure consists of a red Buckinghamshire brisk ‘box’, flanked by single storey extension and all topped by concrete flat roof.  Each facade is punctuated by a large vertical window that allows natural daylight to flood in and at night, be illuminated - making the building, as intended, a beacon in suburbia.

RAF Uxbridge occupies the former estate and grounds of the historic Hillingdon House and has an important connection with Britain's air defence during the World War II.  The original Hillingdon House is thought to have been built in 1617 and was rebuilt in 1717 by the last Duke of Schonberg.  Prior to 1717, the estate had been identified as belonging partly to the manor of Swakeleys and partly to the Manor of Colham.  A Medieval settlement within this area was concentrated within te settlements of Hillingdon, Colham and Uxbridge and it is likely that the site lay within common land and wasteland between these.  The current Hillingdon House was rebuilt in 1844 after being destroyed by fire.  In 1907 the gardens covered 47 acres and contained a five-acre lake formed by a dam in the River Pinn.  The park as a while covered approximatley 158 acres with no significant changes by 1914.  The estate was bought by the Government in 1918 an used as a convalescence home for Canadian soldiers after which it became the RFC Armanent and Gunnery School.  In 1919 the RAF Depot relocated from Halton to the site and became the main recruit-training centre.  During the 1920's new barrack blocks around a large parade ground and other buildings were built to accommodate this.

43652,openplaques:id=43652,Edward Johnston and Charles Holden brown plaque,"Railway Heritage Feature    Directional sign from Blackfriars tube station, (c1930)    This vitreous enamel sign was situated inside the entrance to the original Blackfriars station and was salvaged during the building work in c1975. The station was heavily redeveloped during that period, resulting in the demolition of the original c1870 highly ornate facade. The sign is typical of those designed for use on the Underground during the late 1920s and early 1930s when much thought was given to the standardisation of  sign design and typefaces used.  The sign displays the ones heavy timber frames used – In the early 1930s Charles Holden developed a slimmer bronze frame for signs used on new and reconstructed stations. It appears that many older stations that received new signs at this time continued to have the timber framed versions.    The pale yellow background was also commonly used – along with the use of the purposely designed Johnston black lettering that works so well in this situation being both legible and authoritative. The style of the arrow, the flight of which appears to pierce the ring of the roundel, is also indicative of the sign’s age. This device, commonly known as ‘Mexican arrow’, was used on signs from the mid-1920s until the 1960s as a unique graphic tool and also added familiarity to the brand London Transport.

43653,openplaques:id=43653,Edward Johnston brown plaque,"Railway Heritage Feature    Richmond Station sign   (c1935-38)    This vitreous enamel sign stood, for many years, outside Richmond Richmond mainline station. Photographic evidence shows it in place by the late 1930s and it appears to have been removed during the 1970s.  The date of manufacture can certainly be better understood given the overall design and various styles of lettering and logos it shows.    During the 1930s, when the new London Transport (formed in 1933) experimented with various designs of signs, most used his pale yellow background with the maroon border.  The arrow at the base of the sign was known as a ‘Mexican arrow’ and this example, with three flights on the arrow, dates it to post 1933, as prior to that date it would have had four flights. The sign also uses colour blocks as background to the text and this was increasingly used as a device by the Underground during this period. The design of some signs was further standardised when, in 1938, LT issued the first ‘Standard Signs Manual’.    Richmond was owned and primarily served by the Southern Railway who, during this period developed their own ‘house style’ that included this “sunshine” style of lined out lettering. The underground logo, using the company’s Johnston typeface, has the distinctive white bands (or “ribbons”) above and below the letters. Then, as now, Richmond was served by the district line. The “LMS” lettering refers to the London Midland & Scottish Railway, another of the ‘big four’ railway companies that had been formed in 1923, and ran the North London Railway services between Richmond and Broad Street. This service is now provided by London Overground    The sign is a fascinating reminder of an earlier period of ‘co-ordination’ of elements of London's transport service that finally came to fruition with the formation of TfL. LU acquired the sign in 2008 from a private collector, who had salvaged the sign when it was removed, and is displayed here as part of LU’s heritage.",51.49954,-0.1334,POINT(-0.1334 51.49954),United Kingdom,London,55 Broadway,"",https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4414/36277489732_1240803710_z.jpg,brown,"[""London Transport""]",English,"",,true,true,1,1,0,0,903,openplaques:subject:id=903,Edward Johnston,Johnston,male,1872,1944,man,"[""master calligrapher""]",master calligrapher,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Johnston,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Johnston,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Edward_Johnston.png?width=640,"[""Edward Johnston|(1872-1944)|man|master calligrapher""]"

The map was originally located at the ‘Grade 2 Listed’ Ealing Common station and probably dates from the reconstruction of the station that was completed in 1932. It shows the various different railway companies of that time before they were eventually amalgamated into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, following a series of buyouts and merge that made the Underground Group the largest component of the new ‘London Transport’.

In September of that year more than 500 people died in Soho from the disease.  Snow had studied cholera in the 1848-9 epidemic in South London and developed a novel theory that polluted drinking water caused the disease.  He recognised that cholera cases were clustered around the water pump located here and showed it was the cause of the epidemic.  His theory initially met with some disbelief but he convinced the parish council to remove the pump’s handle on the 8th September 1854, to prevent its further use.  Removal of the pump handle has become an international symbol of public health.  The John Snow Society was founded in 1992 to commemorate Dr Snow’s work.

The station has very little prominence at street level with only limited canopy structures over the park-side entrances.  There were also originally subways that served now demolished tram loading shelters designed so to make best use of space and Holden took great care in the details and finishes to features such as the central columns.  The ceiling, decorated in a pattern of circular mouldings with inset lighting, compliments the unusual shape of the ticket hall.  The platforms were lined to give an elliptical, or egg shaped, profile to enable the recessing of equipement and furniture to give clear lines of sight.  The platforms tiles were originally made by Carter's Poole Potter in Dorset and are similar to other adjacent stations apart from the different coloured border tiles - here they are blue.  Also of note are the bronze ventilation grilles that depict a styalised play on the station name.   These were designed by Harold Stabler R.D.I., a notable artist and designer, who was eleected a ""Royal Designer for Industry"" in 1936.  He was closely connected with the Poole Pottery.  In 2006 a modernisation of the station resulted in the platform wall tilies being sensitively replicated according to the original design.

The current building was built on behalf of London Transport by the London & North Eastern Railway.  It replaced the 1865 Great Eastern railway station that was situated a little to the south which had been built as part of the extension to Epping and Ongar.  The original 1856 station had been located nearer the High Street on what is now the site of Looping Hall.  The station opened for suburban steam train services in 1940 and was transferred to the Underground with the introduction of electrified Central line services on 21 November 1948.  The main structure consists of a high, square block dominated by large arched windows, similar to the facade of Kings Cross mainline station.  The main elevation is flanked by symmetrical, single-storey extensions which extend out at right angles to form flanking walls that frame the public access footpaths.  The whole building, as well as the associated disused signal cabin and sub-station, is finished in carefully monk bonded, incised, gault brick that was imported from the Netherlands. The ticket hall interior takes the form of a lofty arched hall which at one time had a circular ticket dispensing machine in the centre.  The two island platforms are dominated by graceful, gull-wing shaped reinforced canopies that have been subsequently altered, covering over the circular skylights that once formed the edge of the canopies.  A remaining example of this glazing can still be observed in the subway. Original timber platform benches survive, with Underground roundel forming the seat backs, but sadly the original concrete gold wing lighting columns have been lost.",51.6416,0.05516,POINT(0.05516 51.6416),United Kingdom,London,Station Road,"",https://farm66.staticflickr.com/65535/49640594141_fd8decf93c_z.jpg,brown,"[""Transport for London""]",English,"",,true,true,2,2,0,1,23313,openplaques:subject:id=23313,Loughton Station,Station,object,,,man,[],"",,,"","[""Loughton Station||man|"", ""John Murray Easton||man|""]"
